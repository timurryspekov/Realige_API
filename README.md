 Fake photos detection


Journalists face a tremendous challenge in our digital era.
Fake news spreads faster than ever before, undermining public trust in information.
Our goal is to assist journalists in combating this issue.


We have utilized advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision to create a tool that automatically analyzes and classifies images, identifying generated photographs.

Implementation:

1) Authenticity verification of photo

2) Detection of forged documents

3) Protection against DeepFake
